# University-Projects
These are the projects of a computer engineering student who had no previous knowledge in programming. Therefore they are ugly, buggy etc. But it is good to see improvement over the years.

There are descriptions for all assignments, so the objectives and codes can be seen in detail.

If you have questions, feel free to ask me!
